                By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any
                part of the terms then you may not access the Service. </p>

            <p><strong>Termination </strong></p>

            <p>We may terminate or suspend access to our Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, for
                any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.</p>

            <p>All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination,
                including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of
                liability. </p>


            <p><strong>Links To Other Web Sites </strong></p>

            <p>Our Service may contain links to thirdparty web sites or services that are not owned or controlled by
                pattr. </p>

            <p>Pattr has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices
                of any third party web sites or services. You further acknowledge and agree that pattr. shall not be
                responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by

                any such web sites or services. </p>

            <p>We strongly advise you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policies of any thirdparty web
                sites or services that you visit. </p>

            <p><strong>Governing Law </strong></p>

            <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of U.S.A , without regard
                to its conflict of law provisions. </p>

            <p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those
                rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining
                provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between
                us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have between
                us regarding the Service. </p>

            <p><strong>Changes </strong></p>

            <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision
                is material we will try to provide at least 30 days notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What
                constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion. </p>

            <p>By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be
                bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the Service. </p>
